I'm Slope, owner of the HyruleGamingGroup SMP. In my free time, I manage and maintain this server, as well as play fantastic videogames such as Minecraft, The Legend of Zelda and more. I'm not a social media user, so all links provided below have to do with the Minecraft server only.

The server supports both Java and Bedrock edition, and provides a variety of gamemodes such as Survival, Creative, PvP, Rotating Worlds, CraftWare and soon many more.


We are listed on the Official Minecraft Server List, and we are an official Minehut Partner.
