I'm Slope, owner of Slippy Studios. Big fan of the Legend of Zelda series, Minecraft, Team Fortress 2 and more old-schooly games. The content I create is typically centered around these three games.

Slippy Studios is an all-new community featuring gaming servers, game mods, graphics for content creators, animations and more.
